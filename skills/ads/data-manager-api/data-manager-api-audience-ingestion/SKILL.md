# Data Manager API Audience Ingestion

## Core Directives

*   [IMPORTANT] When reading API documentation from developers.google.com, read
    the Markdown equivalent of the page by appending `.md.txt` to the URL.

## Sequential Implementation Workflow

For simple informational, configuration, or setup questions, skip any irrelevant
steps and answer using only the relevant guidelines or documentation provided
below.

### Step 1: Identify Use Case & Read Documentation

-   **Determine Destination Account Type**: [CRITICAL] If it's not
    explicitly stated, STOP and CLARIFY with the user where the data is being
    sent (e.g., Google Ads, Display & Video 360, etc.) BEFORE generating any
    code. Do NOT assume Google Ads by default. This maps to the `account_type`
    field of the `operating_account` in the `Destination`.
-   **Read Documentation**: [CRITICAL] You MUST follow the relevant audience
      upload overview for implementation steps:
    *   **Google Ads Customer Match**: [Upload members to an audience](https://developers.google.com/data-manager/api/devguides/audiences/google-ads/customer-match/upload-data)
    *   **DV360 Customer Match**: [Upload members to an audience](https://developers.google.com/data-manager/api/devguides/audiences/display-video/customer-match/upload-data)

### Step 2: Setup Auth

1.  **Enable API (Prerequisite)**: Check that the user has enabled the Data
    Manager API in their Google Cloud project.
2.  **Generate ADC**: Authenticate the local workspace using Application
      Default Credentials (ADC) via `gcloud auth application-default login`.
      *   **Required Scopes**: Include scopes
          `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datamanager` and
          `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`.
      *   **Multi-API Scopes**: If using the same credentials for other APIs,
          append their scopes (e.g.,
          `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords`).
      *   **Service Accounts**: Ensure the Service Account has the
          `Service Usage Consumer` IAM role, and the user executing `gcloud`
          has the Token Creator role
          (`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`) on that Service Account
          for impersonation.
3.  **Reference**: Refer to [Set up API access](https://developers.google.com/data-manager/api/devguides/quickstart/set-up-access)
    for a walkthrough of the `gcloud` CLI auth setup.

### Step 3: Install Client Library and Utilities

Refer to [Install a client
library](https://developers.google.com/data-manager/api/devguides/quickstart/install-library)
for detailed installation instructions.

| Language | Installation Instructions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python** | `pip install google-ads-datamanager` |
| **Java** | Follow the [quickstart](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/tree/main/java-datamanager#quickstart) instructions to install the Maven/Gradle dependency. |
| **Node** | `npm install @google-ads/datamanager` |
| **PHP** | Install the `googleads/data-manager` component using Composer. |
| **.NET** | Install the `Google.Ads.DataManager.V1` NuGet package. |

[IMPORTANT] The utility library is NOT available on public package managers
(such as PyPI or Maven). Follow the below instructions to install:

1.  Clone the repository from GitHub using the commands from the table below.
2.  Always use the latest available version of the library. Determine the
    actual version identifier (`VERSION`) from the cloned repository metadata.
    - **Python**: Find the version in `pyproject.toml`
    - **Java**: Find the version in `util/package.json` (as the `version`
      field).
    - **Node**: Find the version in `composer.json` (as the `version` field).
3.  Follow the language-specific instructions in the next section to build
    and install the utility dependency, replacing `VERSION` with the version
    identifier you found.

| Language | Git Clone Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python** | `git clone https://github.com/googleads/data-manager-python.git` |
| **Java** | `git clone https://github.com/googleads/data-manager-java.git` |

#### Install Utility Library

##### Python

1.  Navigate to the `data-manager-python` directory and install the utility
    library:
    ```shell
    pip install .
    ```
2.  Declare a dependency in your project's `requirements.txt` file (replacing
    `VERSION` with the identified version):
    ```
   google-ads-datamanager-util=VERSION
    ```

##### Java

1.  Navigate to the `data-manager-java` directory.
2.  Build and publish the utility library to your local Maven repository:
   ```shell
   ./gradlew data-manager-util:install
   ```
3.  Declare a dependency on the utility library in your project (replacing `VERSION` with the identified latest version):
    *   **Gradle**:
     ```none
     implementation 'com.google.api-ads:data-manager-util:VERSION'
     ```

    *   **Maven**:
     ```xml
     <dependency>
        <groupId>com.google.api-ads</groupId>
        <artifactId>data-manager-util</artifactId>
        <version>VERSION</version>
     </dependency>
     ```

##### Node

1.  Navigate to the `data-manager-node` directory and install dependencies:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
2.  Navigate to the `util` directory:
   ```shell
   cd util
   ```
3.  Pack the utility library into a `.tgz` archive:
   ```shell
   npm pack
   ```
4.  Declare a dependency in your Node.js project's `package.json` pointing to
    the path of the generated `.tgz` archive (replacing `VERSION` with the
    identified version):
   ```json
   {
      "dependencies": {
         "@google-ads/data-manager-util": "file:/path/to/google-ads-datamanager-util-VERSION.tgz"
      }
   }
   ```

##### PHP

1.  Navigate to the `data-manager-php` directory.
2.  Resolve dependencies for the library:
   ```shell
   composer update --prefer-dist
   ```
3.  Update your project's `composer.json` to declare a dependency on the utility
    library using a path repository:
   ```json
    {
        "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "path",
                "url": "/path/to/cloned/data-manager-php"
            }
        ],
        "require": {
            "googleads/data-manager-util": "@dev"
        }
    }
   ```

##### .NET

In your .NET project, declare a `ProjectReference` dependency pointing to the
cloned library's `.csproj` path:
```xml
<ProjectReference Include="\path\to\cloned\Google.Ads.DataManager.Util\src\Google.Ads.DataManager.Util.csproj" />
```

### Step 4: Retrieve Code Sample

[IMPORTANT] If writing or updating an ingestion script, ALWAYS retrieve the
relevant code sample to use as a reference:

| Language | Sample |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python** | [`ingest_audience_members.py`](https://github.com/googleads/data-manager-python/blob/main/samples/audiences/ingest_audience_members.py) |
| **Java** | [`IngestAudienceMembers.java`](https://github.com/googleads/data-manager-java/blob/main/data-manager-samples/src/main/java/com/google/ads/datamanager/samples/IngestAudienceMembers.java) |
| **PHP** | [`ingest_audience_members.php`](https://github.com/googleads/data-manager-php/blob/main/samples/audiences/ingest_audience_members.php) |
| **Node** | [`ingest_audience_members.ts`](https://github.com/googleads/data-manager-node/blob/main/samples/audiences/ingest_audience_members.ts) |
| **.NET**| [`IngestAudienceMembers.cs`](https://github.com/googleads/data-manager-dotnet/blob/main/samples/IngestAudienceMembers.cs) |

### Step 5: Retrieve migration guides

[CRITICAL] If refactoring code to upgrade from another Google API, ALWAYS
extract the full contents of the relevant field mapping guide.

#### Google Ads

*   **Google Ads API Customer Match**:
    [Google Ads API to Customer Match Migration Field Mappings](https://developers.google.com/data-manager/api/devguides/audiences/google-ads/customer-match/upgrade/field-mappings)

#### Display & Video 360

*   **Display & Video 360 API Customer Match**:
    [Display & Video 360 API to Customer Match Migration Field Mappings](https://developers.google.com/data-manager/api/devguides/audiences/display-video/customer-match/upgrade/field-mappings)

### Step 6: Implementation

Implement the ingestion logic using the following checkpoints:

-   [ ] **Initialize Client**: Instantiate the Data Manager client
    (`IngestionServiceClient`).
-   [ ] **Define Destinations**: Build the `Destination` object using the
    `product_destination_id` and the appropriate account configurations:
    `operating_account` (target account receiving data), `login_account` (if
    authenticating using a manager account or a data partner account), and
    `linked_account` (if you're a data partner accessing the account via a
    partner link to a manager account). **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**: Refer to
    the [Configure destinations and headers](https://developers.google.com/data-manager/api/devguides/concepts/destinations)
    guide for more details on configuring destinations.
-   [ ] **Format User Data**: Use the utility library helpers to normalize and
    hash user identifiers correctly.
-   [ ] **Construct Payload**: Build the request payload
    (`IngestAudienceMembersRequest`) containing the destinations, formatted
    members, and consent permissions.
-   [ ] **Send Request**: Execute `ingest_audience_members` and record the
    returned request ID for logging/troubleshooting.

## Formatting

*   Fetch the [Format user data](https://developers.google.com/data-manager/api/devguides/concepts/formatting)
    guide and use that as the source of truth for formatting and
    normalization rules.

*   Use the utility library to format, hash, and encrypt user data
    (emails, phone numbers, addresses).

    **Python Example:**
    ```python
    from google.ads.datamanager_util import Formatter
    from google.ads.datamanager_util.format import Encoding

    formatter: Formatter = Formatter()

    processed_email: str = formatter.process_email_address(
        email, Encoding.HEX
    )
    ```

## Critical Gotchas

*   Do NOT set the `address` field on `UserIdentifier` unless all required
    fields are present (`postal_code`, `family_name`, `given_name`,
    `region_code`); incomplete address fields will cause the API request to
    fail.
*  `product_destination_id` must be a numeric string. It is NOT a resource
    name.
*   The enum values for `ConsentStatus` are `CONSENT_GRANTED` and
    `CONSENT_DENIED`. Do not use the values `GRANTED` and `DENIED`.
*   Field names on `UserIdentifier` are `email_address` and `phone_number`. Do
    not use the Google Ads API field names `hashed_email` and
    `hashed_phone_number`.

## Error Handling & Troubleshooting

### Inspecting Error Payloads

[IMPORTANT] Refer to
[Understand API Errors](https://developers.google.com/data-manager/api/devguides/concepts/understand-errors)
for a detailed guide on how to understand the structure of errors returned by
the API.

## API Reference

When implementing or debugging API integrations, use the API reference to lookup
field names, types, and acceptable values. DO NOT guess values.
